Fuel Gauge
===========

This is a custom view of a fuel gauge.  The colors of the gauge can be customized
through the use of attributes.  To set the fuel level, use a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
The title of the gauge defaults to "Fuel", but that can also be set with an attribute.

You can try out this control by downloading the source code and compiling it yourself or
you can download the compiled version from the
[Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unchained.fuelgauge).
